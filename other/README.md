## cubes.txt
This is a file that record all the default Cube Unit descriptions. In a 3d-tetris game, any randomly chosen Cube Unit will be picked from here.

The first line of each cube unit description is the dimension. Each of the following lines describes a row (parallel to x axis). The order of the lines go in increasing order of y, then z.
